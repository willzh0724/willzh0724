# Hello, world! ğŸ‘‹
My name is **Haocheng Zhuang**, you can call me ***William***!

As a User Experience (UX) major, my journey into this field was driven by a passion for understanding how people interact with technology and a desire to make those interactions more intuitive and enjoyable. UX lets me combine creativity with problem-solving to create designs that work well and meet real user needs, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing in this field, where innovation and empathy meet!

> UX isnâ€™t just about creating aesthetically pleasing interfaces â€” it's about crafting meaningful experiences that make life a little bit easier for everyone.ğŸ˜Š
