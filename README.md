# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Haocheng Zhuang, you can call me William!

As a User Experience (UX) major, my journey into this field was driven by a passion for understanding how people interact with technology and a desire to make those interactions more intuitive and enjoyable. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to how design can make things easier and more enjoyable. UX lets me combine creativity with problem-solving to create designs that work well and meet real user needs! ðŸ˜Š
